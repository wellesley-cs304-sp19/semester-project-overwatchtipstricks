NULL	Maximizing Winston Damage	Make sure to hit enemies when landing jumps and punch them as you land for additional burst damage. Also punch enemies to finish them off since melee does a set 30 damage and is faster than using his damage over time primary fire.	4	NULL	Winston	All	Intermediate	2019-04-16 20:14:54
NULL	Tracer Blink Management	Be aware of your Tracer blink count and don't ever expend all 3 without a guaranteed kill or emergency escape situation.	4	NULL	Tracer	All	Beginner	2019-04-16 019-04-16 20:18:16
NULL	Environment Awareness when Genji Blading	"You can dash above the enemy before Q-ing with Genji to get a better idea of enemy positioning. Securing kills will reset Genji dash, allowing for chaining blade kills."	4	NULL	Genji	All	Intermediate	2019-04-16 20:18:16
NULL	Halt Hook Combo	Coordinate an Orisa and Hog to pull enemies out of their position. Use Halt to pull them to a predictable location then hook them in for the team to focus down.	4	NULL	"Orisa, Roadhog"	All	Advanced	2019-04-16 20:20:25
NULL	Defense Matrixing Ultimates	"Be aware of enemy ultimate charge and when they have opportunities to use it. Be frugal with using the defense matrix when in those situations so that it will be off cooldown when an enemy throws an ult (Zarya, Mei ults, etc.)"	4	NULL	D.Va	All	Advanced	2019-04-16 20:22:49
NULL	Hanzo Ultimate	"Using sonic arrow can provide vision on the enemy before ulting as Hanzo. Place the Dragons where the enemy are going, not necessarily where they are. You can also use it to split an enemy team, allowing your team the advantage to follow up on straggling enemies."	4	NULL	Hanzo	All	Intermediate	2019-04-16 20:24:38 
NULL	Ana Grenade Usage	"While Ana nades are a strong healing tool, they are also one of the best offensive tools. Throw them at enemies to block healing. This can be particularly effective in Zarya ults, where the enemy is close together and it could potentially counter an ulting enemy Zenyatta."	4	NULL	Ana	All	Beginner	2019-04-16 20:26:25
NULL	Reinhardt vs Reinhardt Shatters	"While tanks are meant to soak up damage, they should also determine when to not take damage. Be aware of how much shield you have at a given time, and how much the enemy Rein has. This allows you to not get your team Shattered if your shield breaks. Be aware of when the enemy has Shatter and how he is positioning to determine when he tries to execute his ult, so that you can block it."	4	NULL	Reinhardt	All	Advanced	2019-04-16 20:28:29
NULL	Mercy Super Jump	"Crouch when using Guardian Angel, then hit jump before you reach an ally. This will cause Mercy to shoot up into the air."	4	NULL	Mercy	All	Intermediate	2019-04-16 20:31:03
NULL	Walking with Shield	"When closing a gap with a shield hero, jump while you walk. Only shield during jumps, drop shield when you hit the ground. It lets you save shield without taking too much damage."	5	NULL	Brigitte	All	Beginner	2019-04-16 20:33:47
NULL	Pharah Concussion Mine for Mobility	"Pharah's Concussion Mine boops enemies and Pharah herself. You can throw it directly behind you to get a quick boost forwards, which can help position you if necessary, or get back to the point faster."	4	NULL	Pharah	All	Beginner	2019-04-16 20:35:56
NULL	Mercy Superjump	"Crouch and Guardian Angel simultaneously as Mercy. At the very end of the jump, press space. It will launch you pretty high in the air. Good for quick peel. Timing is pretty difficult to pull off consistently."	5	NULL	Mercy	All	Advanced	2019-04-16 20:37:13
NULL	Sombra Invisible Management	"While Sombra's invisibility is very strong for scouting and defense, don't miss engaging in team fights. Being on solo missions for too long leads to forcing your team to fight 5vs6 which gives them the disadvantage."	4	NULL	Sombra	All	Beginner	2019-04-16 20:36:07
NULL	Orisa shield cooldown saver	Throw your shield straight up a few seconds before current shield is about to break. The second or two it takes to land makes the cooldown on the shield come off earlier. Try to time it so that the next shield lands right when current one breaks. I've only ever seen top 500 streamers do this... usually probably not necessary.	5	NULL	Orisa	All	Expert	2019-04-16 20:38:55
NULL	Get Dva mech back faster	"If you get demeched as dva, instead of shooting the bunny blaster to get mech back, just return to spawn, select new hero, then select dva again."	5	NULL	DVa	"2 cp, second point usually best"	Beginner	2019-04-16 20:40:12
NULL	Reinhardt vs. Reinhardt	"When you have Earthshatter, chances are the enemy Reinhardt does, too, and it's your job to protect your team when it happens! The best way to do this is by holding up your shield and letting it drop randomly. Make these pauses long enough that the enemy Reinhardt takes your bait (but not so long that you get hit by Ana's sleepdart, for instance!) and put your shield up the moment the he ults. The rest of your team will thank you!  (If you want to really bait it out, let your shield take damage until it's just above 500 health - the cracks in your shield will make the enemy Reinhardt more likely to ult! Just be careful not to go any lower, because then your shield will break and you'll get Earthshattered anyway.)"	6	NULL	Reinhardt	All	Intermediate	2019-04-16 20:41:35 
NULL	Lucio Melee	"When 1v1ing other players as Lucio, melee before booping to add more damage, since boops will put them out of melee range."	4	NULL	Lucio	All	Beginner	2019-04-17 20:41:35 
NULL	Lucio Peel	"If a teammate extends too far and is trying to return to the team, you're better off speeding them to get them out of danger faster than trying to amp heals and out pace the damage they're likely sponging up."	4	NULL	Lucio	All	Intermediate	2019-04-17 20:56:11 
NULL	Reinhardt Shield Save on EMP	"When I Sombra EMP is going to hit, drop your shield because EMP will break the shield. If you survive the emp, you will still have a healthy shield, as opposed to a broken one."	4	NULL	Reinhardt	All	Advanced	2019-04-17 20:57:18
NULL	Blocking Lucio Ultimate	"Lucio's ultimate is based on Line of Sight, you can use shields to block his ult from hitting his teammates. For example, putting a Winston bubble around Lucio right before he ults, or holding a Reinhardt Shield or placing an Orisa shield between the Lucio and his team."	4	NULL	Winston	All	Advanced	2019-04-17 21:09:39
NULL	Zarya Bubble Block	You can use your self bubble to body block a D.Va bomb or other damage if a teammate can't escape fast enough and your team bubble is on cool-down.	4	NULL	Zarya	All	Advanced	2019-04-17 21:26:43
